Task 1:  The program should find all the triangular numbers that are within a range specified by 
the user and print them. For example, if the user chooses to print such numbers in the [1, 40] 
range, the program should print 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36. The program should print next to each 
triangle number if it is odd or even and also give two separate counts of how many odd and even 
triangle numbers were found. In addition, the program should find and print two products: 1) the 
product of all the odd triangular numbers and 2) the products of the even triangular numbers 
found within the range given.
