//Task 2:

Find all the numbers that can be written as the product of two natural numbers in 
succession and print them in increasing order. The calculations should start from an initial value 
chosen by the user (For example, if the user decides to start from 5, the first number that should 
be in your output is 30 as 5*6=30, where 5 and 6 are two natural numbers in succession). The user 
should specify how many such numbers they want to print. For each number found the program 
should also check/state whether the number found is a factor of a positive integer x, where x is 
another input specified by the user.
